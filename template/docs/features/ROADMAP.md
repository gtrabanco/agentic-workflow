# Roadmap

The single source of truth for feature **numbering, ordering, and dependencies**.
Every feature folder under `docs/features/<NN>-<slug>/` must have a row here, and
every row must have a folder (or be explicitly marked "scheduled").

## Features

| NN | Slug | Status | Depends on | Summary |
|----|------|--------|------------|---------|
| 01 | `<slug>` | planned | — | `<one line>` |

## Status legend

- `planned` — in the roadmap, not started
- `in-progress` — branch open, phases executing
- `done` — built and its PR open (the last step opened the PR); **merge state lives
  in the forge**, not the status — a `done` row may still be awaiting a human merge

## Conventions

- Numbers are assigned in order and never reused.
- A feature that depends on another cannot start until its dependency is **merged**
  (not merely `done` — a `done` dep with an open PR isn't on `main` yet).
- Keep this table consistent with the feature folders (the `audit-docs` skill
  checks for drift).
